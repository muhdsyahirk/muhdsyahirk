## Intro

Hi and welcome to my mini-blog. I'll be using this space to share my experiences and the things I've learned in IT and Cybersecurity. Most of the content here will be the journey I'm currently taking to improve my skills.

## More About Me

During my degree, I took courses and did some projects that are related to cybersecurity. Outside of university, I joined a few CTFs where I learned new attacks and gained more hands-on experience. I also took online courses that helped me explore more tools in Kali Linux, and then tried them in my home network to understand how they work in real scenarios.

I noticed that I lean more toward the Blue Team. I enjoy learning how the attackers think, but detecting them is more challenging, which makes it more interesting to me.

Aside from cybersecurity, I also enjoy building websites (and software). I can literally spend 24/7 trying to perfect the design or fix small details that no one else would notice. Even though I'm not really that creative, I often visit other websites or UI designs for inspiration and then give them some tweak to match my own style.
